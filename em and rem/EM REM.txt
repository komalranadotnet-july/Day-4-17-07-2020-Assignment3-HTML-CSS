EM- Relative to the font-size of the element (2em means 2 times the size of the current font).In CSS, an em unit is equal to the computed font-size for the element to which the em is applied. 
         When em units are declared on child elements that don’t have a font-size defined, they will inherit their font-size from their parent, or from another ancestor element, possibly going all the way 
         back to the root element on the document.	

REM - Relative to font-size of the root element.The rem unit in CSS always inherits its value from the base font size setting on the root element of the document, irrespective of the computed font size. 
            In HTML, the root element is always the html element. So you could use rems, but this would mean you’ll have to control all components on the page using the font size on that element. It could
            work on certain projects, but I  this technique works best when focusing the resizability on an isolated component, rather than the whole document.
